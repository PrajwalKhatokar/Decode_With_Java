1.Two sum:(Refer the leetcode my Profile)
meaning array edhe { 3,-1,8,5,4,9,2}
target = 9

means i should get the only one pair which is equal to the target and return there index
by storing in the array for this i can also do optimization for now not required

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

2.Two Pointer-> Which means Reverse an Array Oh simple.
lets solve here only full code in my package with explanation cool and easy.
case 1: reverse full
case 2: specific part i need to reverse ok na.

3.Rotate Array:--> RotateArray.java
Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
